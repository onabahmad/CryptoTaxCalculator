        <h4>1. How are cryptocurrencies taxed in Australia?</h4>{" "}
        <p>
          The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) regards cryptocurrency as both
          property, which is subject to Capital Gains Tax (CGT), and income,
          which is subject to Income Tax. CGT applies when you sell, trade,
          gift, or make purchases using cryptocurrency. On the other hand,
          Income Tax applies when you receive cryptocurrency as payment for
          services, work, mining, staking, or other activities. To simplify tax
          calculations, consider using a free crypto tax calculator for

          2. What's the difference between long-term and short-term capital
          gains?
        </h4>{" "}
        <p>
          The distinction between long-term and short-term capital gains lies in
          the duration of ownership. When you own an asset, such as
          cryptocurrency, for more than 12 months, any gains from its sale are
          categorised as long-term. These long-term gains often receive a 50%
          discount on the capital gains tax (CGT). In contrast, if you hold the
          asset for 12 months or less, the gains are considered short-term, and
          they are taxed at your regular income tax rate.

        <h4>3. Do I have to pay tax on crypto-to-crypto transactions?</h4>{" "}
        <p>
          Yes, according to the ATO, when you trade one cryptocurrency for
          another, like NFTs, stablecoins, or tokens, it's seen as selling one
          asset to buy another, and any profit you make from this exchange is
          subject to Capital Gains Tax. To compute taxes for crypto-to-crypto
          transactions, you must determine the fair market value of your coins
          in AUD at both the acquisition and disposal times. However, this can
          be challenging because many exchanges use cryptocurrency as the
          standard for valuation Explore KoinX for a streamlined experience in
          calculating your cryptocurrency taxes. Our historical price engine
